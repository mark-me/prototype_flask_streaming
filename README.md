# Prototype Flask Streaming

This project is a prototype web application built with Flask that allows you to manage configuration files, run processes, and stream real-time output to the browser. The application supports editing configurations, starting processes, live output streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE), sending input to the process, and downloading log files.

## Features

- **Configuration Management:** View, edit, and save configuration files through the web interface.
- **Process Execution:** Start a process based on a selected configuration file.
- **Live Output:** Follow the process output in real-time via a streaming endpoint.
- **Send Input:** Dynamically send input to the active process.
- **Download Logs:** Download CSV log files generated by the process.
- **About Page:** View application information rendered from a Markdown file.

## Installation

### Requirements

   - Python 3.7+
   - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - As the web-app framework
   - [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) - for reading YAML files
   - [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) - To turn markdown into html content
   - [ansi2html](https://ansi2html.readthedocs.io/) - To capture ANSI escape sequences in the CLI output and turn it into html formatting

   Install the required packages with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install flask pyyaml markdown ansi2html
   ```

## Project Structure
