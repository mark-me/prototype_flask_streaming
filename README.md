# Prototype Flask Streaming

This project is a prototype web application built with Flask that allows you to manage configuration files, run processes, and stream real-time output to the browser. The application supports editing configurations, starting processes, live output streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE), sending input to the process, and downloading log files.

## Features

- **Configuration Management:** View, edit, and save configuration files through the web interface.
- **Process Execution:** Start a process based on a selected configuration file.
- **Live Output:** Follow the process output in real-time via a streaming endpoint.
- **Send Input:** Dynamically send input to the active process.
- **Download Logs:** Download CSV log files generated by the process.
- **About Page:** View application information rendered from a Markdown file.
